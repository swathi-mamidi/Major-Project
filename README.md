# Major Project- Calculating Ground Reaction Using an IMU Sensor and Integration with Image-Based Classification

# Project Overview

This project focuses on estimating ground reaction forces using IMU sensors and integrating the data with image-based classification models to enhance motion analysis. Our team of five worked in an Agile development environment to build a robust machine learning model and computer vision model capable of accurately predicting joint movements and predicting what type of affect going to cause by patient further and by computer vision model will predict whether the person posture and exercise is correct or not.

# Key Features

# Machine Learning & Classification:

Trained models using Linear Regression and Decision Tress Regressors on Data.

Achieved 92% accuracy with Linear Regression and  Decision Tree for motion prediction and affect going to cause further.

# Computer Vision & Joint Movement Analysis:

Integrated the OpenPose Computer Vision library to capture and analyze joint movements.

Combined motion tracking with IMU sensor data to improve performance.

# Future Enhancements:

Planning to develop a voice instructions to the patient while doing the exercise.

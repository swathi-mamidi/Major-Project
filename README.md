# Major Project- Calculating Ground Reaction Using an IMU Sensor and Integration with Image-Based Classification

# Project Overview

This project focuses on estimating ground reaction forces using IMU sensors and integrating the data with image-based classification models to enhance motion analysis. Our team of five worked in an Agile development environment to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting joint movements.

# Key Features

# Machine Learning & Classification:

Trained models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers on a large dataset.

Achieved 95% accuracy with SVM and 88% accuracy with KNN for motion prediction.

# Computer Vision & Joint Movement Analysis:

Integrated the OpenPose Computer Vision library to capture and analyze joint movements.

Combined motion tracking with IMU sensor data to improve classification performance.

# Future Enhancements:

Planning to develop a physical prototype in the upcoming semester to validate the model in real-world scenarios.

Exploring deep learning approaches to further enhance accuracy and real-time motion tracking.
